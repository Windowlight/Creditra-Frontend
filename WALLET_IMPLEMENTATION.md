### Error Messages

### Success State

- Message: "You're all set to start using Creditra"

### Onboarding
- Step 1: "Welcome to Creditra" - "Your adaptive credit protocol on Stellar blockchain"
- Step 2: "Credit Evaluation" - "We analyze your on-chain activity to determine your credit limit and terms"
- Step 3: "Flexible Credit Lines" - "Draw and repay credit as needed with dynamic interest rates based on your risk profile"

## Technical Notes

### Wallet Integration
Currently uses mock wallet detection. To integrate real wallets:

1. **Freighter**: Install `@stellar/freighter-api`
```typescript
import { isConnected, getPublicKey, getNetwork } from "@stellar/freighter-api";
```

2. **Albedo**: Install `@albedo-link/intent`
```typescript
import albedo from '@albedo-link/intent';
```

### LocalStorage Keys
- `wallet_info`: Stores connected wallet information
- `wallet_preference`: Stores preferred wallet type
- `onboarding_completed`: Tracks onboarding completion

### State Management
Uses React Context API for global wallet state. All components can access wallet info via `useWallet()` hook.

### Auto-Reconnect UX
When a remembered wallet reconnect is still in progress after the timeout window, the app shows a non-blocking banner with a retry action and a dismiss control. The banner is announced to assistive tech via an assertive live region and remains responsive while the reconnect continues in the background.
